Transaction 
-----------

Motivation behind a transaction is data integrity. Read operation there is no data integrity issues as nothing changes for read operations.

In JDBC setAutoCommit to false on the connection object marks the beginning of an explicit transaction. Everything in between then and a COMMIT/ROLLBACK is the body of the transaction. COMMIT / ROLLBACK does not set the Autocommit property to false.
